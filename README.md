# cpp-mad-libs
A C++ project used to create a mad-libs using a linked list (pointers) to store user responses.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/sdekhterman/cpp-population-growth.git
```
3. **Compile the code** using a C++ compiler.
```
g++ -o population main.cpp
```
3. **Execute the compiled executable** to start the program.
```
./population.exe
```

## TODO: 
1) Add each time step as a node in the linked list
2) Add a death rate and make both birth and death vary given some transition probability
3) how to compile different files at once using a cmake
4) add user interactions
5) output population and rates vs time to a figure
